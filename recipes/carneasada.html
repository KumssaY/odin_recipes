        <p>Lisa's Favorite Carne Asada Marinade is a delectable combination of citrusy and savory flavors, perfect for enhancing the taste of marinated steak. The marinade typically consists of ingredients like fresh lime and orange juice, minced garlic, chopped cilantro, cumin, chili powder, and other spices, creating a zesty and aromatic profile. This flavorful blend works to tenderize the meat while infusing it with a delicious blend of tanginess and smokiness. When grilled, the carne asada takes on a mouthwatering char and remains juicy, resulting in a savory and satisfying culinary experience.</p>

        <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine ¼ cup of fresh lime juice, ¼ cup of fresh orange juice, 4 minced garlic cloves, ¼ cup of chopped cilantro, 1 teaspoon of ground cumin, 1 teaspoon of chili powder, ½ teaspoon of ground black pepper, and 1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
            <li>Slowly drizzle in ¼ cup of olive oil while whisking the mixture to emulsify the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Optionally, add 1 tablespoon of soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce for additional depth of flavor.</li>
            <li>Place the marinade in a zip-top bag or a shallow dish suitable for marinating.</li>
            <li>Add the steak to the bag or dish, ensuring it is fully coated with the marinade. For best results, use flank steak or skirt steak, which are traditionally used for carne asada.</li>
            <li>Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or ideally, overnight, allowing the flavors to penetrate the meat.</li>
            <li>Before grilling, remove the steak from the marinade and discard any excess marinade.</li>
            <li>Grill the steak over high heat for about 4-6 minutes per side, or until it reaches the desired level of doneness.</li>
            <li>Allow the steak to rest for a few minutes before slicing it against the grain into thin strips.</li>
            <li>Serve the deliciously marinated carne asada with your favorite accompaniments, such as tortillas, salsa, guacamole, and grilled onions and peppers.</li>
